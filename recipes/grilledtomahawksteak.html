        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for <br> sharing with  friends and family.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak <br> seasoning, garlic  powder, and onion powder in a small airtight <br>container; shake or stir to  combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak <br> rub to use in compound butter.</li>
            <li>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, <br> and sides  with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak,<br> uncovered, in the  refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.</li>
           <li>Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on <br> both sides,  about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat,<br> so be mindful of flame  flare-ups. The internal temperature should <br> now read 125 to 135 degrees <br> F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.<br> Let butter  melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots,<br> and chives. Let steak  rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.<br>  Be sure to serve the boneâ€“someone will want to gnaw on it!</li>
        </ol>
