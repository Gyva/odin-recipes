        <p>The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and <br> lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>

        <h1>Grilled Tomahawk Steak</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with <br> friends and family.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic  <br> powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to <br> combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.</li>
            <li>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides <br> with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the <br> refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.</li>
            <li>For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved <br> 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash together with a fork until <br> evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and <br> refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill <br> off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method <br> is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an instant-read thermometer. <br> If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to <br> 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read <br> thermometer inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about <br> 45 minutes. Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor grill for <br> high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>When steak reaches an internal temperature of  110 degrees F (43 degrees C) <br> measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from the oven.</li>
            <li>Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, <br> about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame <br> flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees <br> F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top. Let butter <br> melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots, and chives. Let steak <br> rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter. Be sure to <br> serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!</li>
        </ul>
