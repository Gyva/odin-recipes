# odin-recipes

odin-recipes is a project with recipes content where users can 
1. Find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier.

2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

4. Finally, under the ingredients list, user can find “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
